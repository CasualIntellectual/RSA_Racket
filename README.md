# RSA_Racket

RSA Encryption Program in Racket

This program uses the RSA Scheme in order to
encrypt and decrypt ciphertext messages.

Limitations: Ciphertext must be some natural number (or text converted to a numerical value).
             Large distict primes p and q with > 300 decimal
             digits each must be randomly selected for sufficient
             security

Am looking to convert the code to Python or C and implement a prime number generator.
